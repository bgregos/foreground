Foreground is an easy to use task manager app. Designed to be beautiful, simple and unintrusive, Foreground helps you know what needs done without getting in your way. Foreground also supports syncing with Taskwarrior servers, so your task list can be always with you, no matter your device.

In other words, Foreground tells you what needs to be in your own foreground!

### Download

You can find Foreground on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.bgregos.brighttask), on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.bgregos.brighttask/) and in the [Releases](https://github.com/bgregos/foreground/releases) tab.

## Features
Foreground includes the following features:
- Mobile task management
- Syncing with Taskwarrior servers, also known as taskservers. This feature is in Beta.
- Automatically sync on an interval
- Task due notifications
- Filters. You can filter by name, project, tags, and more.
- A enhanced tablet experience for optimum productivity
- A widget

More features are planned!

## Syncing
To set up sync, add your Taskwarrior server credentials (provided by your taskd server or a service like FreeCinc) to the settings menu, and enable sync using the toggle. A test will be run to check if the settings are valid, and the enable will stick if your configuration is correct. You can also configure automatic syncing in this menu, or click the sync button on the main page to start a sync.

## Current Limitations
Unlike existing Taskwarrior apps for Android, Foreground does not run the `taskwarrior` binary inside, but rather implements a Taskwarrior sync client.

That being said, Foreground currently supports most features of Taskwarrior. The primary exception involves handling of recurring events. Recurring event instances created by other clients will be shown by Foreground, but Foreground does not create recurring event instances of its own at this time. These limitations will be resolved in future releases.
